Leveling Up Bard with Extensions
=================================

\--

Race between pre-trained Large Language Models is getting competitive day by day and Google Bard is one of those LLMs that‚Äôs on the top of that competition. Recently Google Bard introduced ‚ÄúExtensions‚Äù feature in the latest update, stepping up its game . I always knew it was only just a matter of time before this happens and finally google did it. Through Extensions, you now can extend capabilities of bard to the google eco-system. Yes, i mean google docs, google sheets, google maps, youtube etc. Every google tool we use in day to day life will be integrated with google Bard and make our life more easier. So, i decided to give it a try and see how good it works.

So what you have to do first. Just access [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) using your web browser. In there you‚Äôll see an icon to access Bard‚Äôs Extensions feature (as shown below).

then you can see the available extensions and you can turn them on/off if needed.

Google Bard Extensions

The first time you are writing a prompt related to any google service bard will ask you to connect to your Google Workspace. After giving access you are good to go. Is that all ? yes. Now Bard is able to access the Google Workspace, Youtube, Maps related to the Google Account that you are logged in to the Bard. When you are submiting the prompt Bard gonna identify your intent and use the relevant extension itself. As an example if keywords like mail or email is in the prompt it gonna use the Google Workspace extension and access the emails automatically. Also you can specify the Extension it must use by typing ‚Äò@‚Äô in the prompt and bard gonna provide you all the services you can access through Extensions and then you select the one you need.

**Bard to Gmail**
-----------------

first, let‚Äôs test out how effectively Bard works with the gmail. Today at 01.20 AM I received an email from Coursera regarding degrees available on IIT Guwahati and the deadline for the application.

Email received from Coursera

So, now let‚Äôs ask Bard to summarize the content of this email.

Summarizing the Email content

As you can see Bard is able to summarize the email content as we expected. Now let‚Äôs ask Bard Did how many email i received from Google Bard in this month?

Getting the no of emails received from Coursera

Now let‚Äôs take a different approach. Recently i received an email from GDG sri lanka regarding the Keras Community they are organizing.

Search for emails received from GDG Sri Lanka

As you see here, now i can get quick glance at my emails without even visiting my gmail inbox.

**Bard to Google Docs**
-----------------------

From gmail let‚Äôs move to the Google Docs, shall we? I‚Äôm gonna ask Bard to access a specific document in my Google Drive and Summarize it‚Äôs content for me. Bard gonna find the document and summarize it‚Äôs content for me as I expected.

Summarizing Google Doc Content

You may have used services like ChatPDF to do to get answers to questions you have based on a PDF file you‚Äôve uploaded. Let‚Äôs try to do the same using Bard.

QnA based on the document

So this is bit weird. Bard was able to answer the second question but it was unable to answer the first even though document clearly state the Revenue‚Äôs of 2020 and 2021. So yes, this won‚Äôt work every time for you, But still i am impressed it answered the second question accurately.

**Bard to Youtube**
-------------------

We explored how Bard is able to work with both gmail and Google Docs up until now and now I want to try out how Bard works with Youtube. For the start, i thought about asking a question related to one of my most favorite Youtube Channels. Again, Bard failed to give me the correct answer. Because I‚Äôm big fan of this Youtube Channel, Ialready know they released a new video 3 days ago.

Bard searched through Youtube to answer the questions

Then I again tried it without using the extensions and now it was able to give the right one. I don‚Äôt know how the Youtube actually works, but I am curious why Bard couldn‚Äôt give the the correct answer in the 1st try.

Trying again without Extensions

In my next attempt i tried something general. I asked Bard to suggest me some youtube videos related React JS and i happy with its response.

Asking Bard for some Youtube Suggestions

Then I thought about try out something challenging and I wanted Bard to go through one of my public youtube playlists and pull a video from it. But It seems this is a task Bard is still not able to perfom.

**Bard to Google Maps**
-----------------------

Now let‚Äôs try to access Google Maps through the Bard. As my first question I asked Bard to show me the nearest filling station and it provided me the nearest filling stations to my location as i expected.

Finding a nearest location

After that i wanted to see it will show me the route from my location to one of those filling stations. So, yes Google Maps integration works well with the Bard.

Showing the route to a location from the current location

Bard is even able to provide information about the bus routes while integrating with Google Maps and i think sometimes this will be much easier that accessing the Google Maps app in my phone.

Asking about a bus route

This was a quick look at the new Google Bard Extensions and exploration of their capabilities. As we‚Äôve seen, this innovation brings Google‚Äôs ecosystem even closer to our daily lives, offering seamless integration with services like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, and YouTube. While it may not always provide perfect answers or outcomes, the potential and convenience it offers are undeniable. As this feature matures, we can expect more accurate responses, better performance across various google services, and an even smoother user experience. Until then, keep Bard-ing away and enjoying the seamless integration it brings to the digital world!
